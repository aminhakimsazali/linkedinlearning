what is GitHub?
------
~~GitHub~~ is a platform for *hosting* and sharing code **repositories.** It allows developers to collaborate on projects, `track` changes, and manage versions of their code. It uses Git, a distributed version control system, to keep track of every change made to the codebase.
What is Version Control?
Version control is a system that records changes to files over time so you can recall specific versions later. It helps teams:

```
let x = 5;
console.log(X);
```
> Collaborate efficiently without overwriting each other’s work.
Track history of changes and revert if needed.
Branch and merge to develop new features without breaking the main code.
